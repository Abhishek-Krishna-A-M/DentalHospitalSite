                <p>Dental emergencies include severe tooth pain, knocked-out teeth, broken or cracked teeth, lost fillings or crowns, abscesses, and injuries to the mouth or jaw. If you're experiencing severe pain or trauma, contact us immediately.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>What should I do if I knock out a tooth?</h3>
